# DeepQ-Learning

Deep Q-Learning agent built to solve Open AI gym Cart Pole problem. Following the pytorch tutorial, this agent was built to better understand the reinforcement learning process, and the underlying concepts and equations that define Deep Q-Learning, such as policies, Q functions, and the bellman equation. 

Beyond the tutorial, this notebook then saves the successful agent state dictionaries to be loaded at a later time, and creates a video output of the trained model solving the Cart Pole problem as can be seen here:
